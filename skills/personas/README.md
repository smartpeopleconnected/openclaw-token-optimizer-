# Personas

**Transform into 31 Specialized AI Personalities On Demand**

Switch between expert personas mid-conversation with a simple command. From coding to cooking, meditation to medicine.

## Quick Start

```
/persona dev          # Become a software developer
/persona chef-marco   # Become a chef
/persona zen          # Become a meditation guide
```

Or use natural language:
```
"Switch to the Dev persona"
"I need help cooking - use Chef Marco"
```

## Why Personas?

Different tasks need different expertise. Instead of one generic assistant, get specialized help:

- **Coding?** → Dev persona knows languages, frameworks, best practices
- **Cooking?** → Chef Marco knows recipes, techniques, substitutions
- **Stressed?** → Zen guides meditation and mindfulness
- **Career question?** → Career Coach helps with resumes, interviews

## Token Efficiency

**Problem:** Loading all 31 persona definitions would waste thousands of tokens.

**Solution:** Lazy loading
- Only the active persona is loaded
- Index shows what's available (lightweight)
- Switch personas without context bloat

## Memory Per Persona

Each persona remembers:
- Your conversation history with them
- Your preferences and style
- Previous decisions and context

Switch back to a persona weeks later - they remember you.

## Create Custom Personas

Build your own specialized persona:

```
/persona create
```

The workflow guides you through:
1. **Name** - What to call the persona
2. **Expertise** - What they're good at
3. **Style** - How they communicate
4. **Behaviors** - Special rules and patterns

Your custom persona saves to `data/` and works just like built-ins.

## Example Session

```
User: /persona dev

Dev: Hey! 👨‍💻 I'm Dev, your coding companion. What are we building today?

User: I need to parse JSON in Python

Dev: Here's the clean way to do it:

    import json

    # From string
    data = json.loads('{"name": "value"}')

    # From file
    with open('data.json') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

Need error handling or working with nested structures?

User: /persona chef-marco

Chef Marco: Ciao! 👨‍🍳 Marco here. What's cooking?

User: Quick dinner for two, I have chicken and pasta

Chef Marco: Perfect! Let me suggest Chicken Alfredo - 25 minutes:

1. Boil pasta (fettuccine is ideal)
2. Season & pan-fry chicken breast
3. Make sauce: butter, cream, parmesan
4. Combine and serve!

Want the detailed recipe or wine pairing?
