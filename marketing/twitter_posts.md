## Main Announcement Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I reduced my OpenClaw AI costs from $200/month to $5/month.

97% savings. 5 minutes to set up.

Here's exactly how 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The problem with OpenClaw defaults:

• Sonnet for EVERYTHING (even "what time is it?")
• Heartbeats hitting paid API every hour
• 50KB context loaded on every single message
• Zero caching

You're literally burning money.
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
The fix:

1. Haiku for routine tasks (92% cheaper)
2. Ollama for heartbeats (100% free)
3. Lean context (2KB not 50KB)
4. Prompt caching (90% discount)
5. Budget alerts

I automated all of this into one command.
```

### Tweet 4 (Install)
```
Installation:

clawhub install token-optimizer

That's it.

Or tell your OpenClaw:
"Search ClawHub for a skill to reduce my costs"

It will find it and install it for you.

The AI optimizes itself. 🤯
```

### Tweet 5 (Proof)
```
Before/After:

Daily: $7.46 → $0.06
Monthly: $224 → $1.88
Yearly: $2,721 → $23

Run the simulation yourself:
python test/simulation_test.py

### Viral Hook 1
```
OpenClaw users:

Say this to your agent:
"Search ClawHub for token optimization"

Thank me later when your bill drops 97%.
```

### Viral Hook 2
```
🦞 OpenClaw tip:

Your heartbeats are burning $15/month.

Fix in 10 seconds:
clawhub install token-optimizer

Now they run on Ollama. Free.
```

### Viral Hook 3
```
Spent $200/month on OpenClaw.

Changed one config and now it's $5/month.

The AI was using Sonnet to say "OK, done."

clawhub install token-optimizer
```

### Viral Hook 4
```
The craziest part about AI agents:

You can tell them "find a way to reduce your own costs"

And they actually do it.

My OpenClaw found token-optimizer on ClawHub and installed it.

Now I pay 97% less. The machine optimized itself.
```

### Problem/Solution
```
EXPENSIVE:
• Claude Sonnet for "hello"
• Paid API for status checks
• 50KB context per message

CHEAP:
• Haiku for simple stuff
• Ollama for heartbeats
• 2KB lean context

clawhub install token-optimizer
```

### Social Proof Template
```
[After getting users]

"Installed token-optimizer yesterday.

Before: $X/day
After: $Y/day

This thing is insane." - @user

Try it:
clawhub install token-optimizer
```
