### Short Description (100 chars)
Slash OpenClaw API costs by 97% with intelligent model routing, free heartbeats, and prompt caching.

### Medium Description (250 chars)
Stop burning tokens on routine tasks. Token Optimizer configures OpenClaw to use Haiku by default, routes heartbeats to free local LLMs, enables prompt caching, and adds budget controls. Go from $1,500/month to $50/month in 5 minutes.

### Full Description

**Are you watching your OpenClaw API bills climb?**

The default configuration prioritizes capability over cost - meaning you're burning expensive Sonnet tokens on simple tasks that Haiku handles perfectly.

**Token Optimizer fixes this with 4 key optimizations:**

1. **Smart Model Routing** - Haiku by default, Sonnet only when needed (92% savings)
2. **Free Heartbeats** - Route status checks to Ollama instead of paid API (100% savings)
3. **Lean Sessions** - Load 8KB instead of 50KB context per message (80% savings)
4. **Prompt Caching** - 90% discount on repeated system prompts

**Results our users see:**

| Monthly Cost | $70-90 | $3-5 |
| Context Size | 50KB | 8KB |
| Heartbeat Cost | $5-15/mo | $0 |
